  Hello!
</p>

<p>
  We are learning about receiving gifts.  Here is one I have for you.  It is a meditation, an audio file, and I would like for you to listen to it!
</p>

<p>
  You should be able to open this file on any computer and load it onto any phone, device or player.  If you would like to share it with someone else, you can, but I ask that instead of sending them your file, please direct them to <%= link_to 'receiveeverything.com', root_url %> and tell them that they can get the meditation, and more, by just providing their email address (or signing up via Facebook).  Thank you!!  The choice is yours, and it's not a huge deal.  I trust you to do what makes sense in the situation.  If you send them to me, then we can explore a whole world of possibilities together.  That's worth a lot more than this first file - you'll see.
</p>

<p>
  The iseries consists of 5 meditations.

  You have the first one.  For the other four I ask a few dollars.  There are some other exciting projects I'd love to share with you as well.

<p>
  I convene a monthly group for women (and other people) to explore and expand their feminine energy.  To join the Receptivity Goddess Group, <%= link_to 'fill out the application on this page.', new_goddess_url %>

<p>
  If you live in or near Brooklyn, or can travel there, you can join us in person on Monday evenings (7-9 PM on the first Monday of each month).  Alternately, you are welcome to join the online group, which meets on Thursday afternoons (1-3 PM on the first Thursday of each month).  I believe that this group is one of the best investments you can make in evolving your attitude, your skills and your life.  I highly recommend that you join the Receptivity Goddess Group!

<p>
  Thank you so very much!

<p>
  Sincerely,
